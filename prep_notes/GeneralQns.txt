I'm looking for a bigger challenge and to grow my career 
There isn't room for growth with my current employer and I'm ready to move on to a new challenge.

I am interested in a job with more responsibility, and I am very ready for a new challenge.
I am seeking a position with a stable company with room for growth and opportunity for advancement.


why want to join this company?
I would like to work in a place where I can see my work making difference in the world. In that manner yours is such a company where I can see my contribution making difference to customers. 

My current projects:

1. ESM consumer for consuming events from Event broker 
2. Event Flow conectables to support ipv6
3. Creating zoning interface for better modularization
4. Single sign on
5. Event Statistics 

Most Hardest bug:
1. Asset->Zone->N/w. To find the asset and the associated network, need to go via zone to join the tables.But some zones doesn't have diret n/w associated instead its parent have n/w associated, so those zones were returning null for the n/w's. So the solution is to do trasitive call to the parent to get the n/w instead of just going one level up.â€™]

Most Challenging:
Customer escalations

Most Intersting:
Event broker integration
Apple POS
-> Customer facing while going live
Hongkong project
pre-launch test
live support etc

Learned:
Most of the codes are created by years ago whom would have left the company. If we get to go through those codes, make sure to document what we understand in the form of some UML diagram or any sort which future developers can easily understand instead of going through that old code again.
