Techniques:

 Modularize the code 
 If none of the DS fit in to our need, create your own DS
 
 Bit Manipulations:
 
   1. Multiplying by 4 is nothing but left shifting mby 2.  Multiplying by 2 is left shifting by 1
   2. a^(~a) will be sequence of 1.
   
   
   Tree:
   1. Always pass in the variable in recursive call if we need to keep track of it like height instead of having it as local variable.
   2. Check how to test the recursive calls.
